Assignment 1 (Adapter Pattern): The AudioPlayer plays various audio types (MP3, WAV, AAC) using an adapter to handle formats other than MP3.
Assignment 2 (Bridge Pattern): The universal remote control can work with multiple devices (TVDevice, DVDDevice) using a bridge to decouple the abstraction from the implementation.
Assignment 3 (Composite Pattern): A menu system that can contain other menus and menu items, allowing hierarchical structure through the composite pattern.
Assignment 4 (Decorator Pattern): A flexible pizza ordering system, where base pizza types can be decorated with multiple toppings.
Assignment 5 (Facade Pattern): A simplified interface for controlling multiple smart home devices (lights, thermostat, security, entertainment system).
Assignment 6 (Flyweight Pattern): A memory-efficient text editor that uses flyweights to share character objects, demonstrating efficient memory usage with large texts.
Assignment 7 (Proxy Pattern): A proxy for video lectures that loads them only when the student starts watching, simulating lazy loading for video resources.

Each assignment is encapsulated within the Main class and demonstrates the key aspects of its corresponding design pattern.
